-- Supplemental global special-module market seed.
-- Adds Officer, Deadspace (including Pith), Faction and Storyline modules
-- to the same randomly selected station set used by seed_market.sql.
--
-- Run after seed_market.sql. The regular published modules are already seeded
-- by seed_market.sql; this script adds rare meta-group modules only.
-- Existing station/type sell orders are preserved, so this is safe to rerun.
--
-- Configure the target region and station saturation to match seed_market.sql.
